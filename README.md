# DataScraper

Simple python script for scraping .csv files generated by Datatree.com

This script gives the option to manually scrape one .csv using the datascraper.bat file. The original and scraped .csv files will remain in the same directory.

It can also scrape multiple files using the autoScrape.bat file. Note that the scraped .csv files will be stored in the 'Scraped Files' in the directory and orignal .csv files are moved to the 'Raw Files' in the directory

See autoScrape.bat and datascraper.bat for instructions on how to set up both files for this script to work.

Note: When setting the directory location in the .bat files where .csv files are stored. Do not end the path with a '\'. 
Example: 'C:\Users\Username\Folder Location' instead of 'C:\Users\Username\Folder Location\'
